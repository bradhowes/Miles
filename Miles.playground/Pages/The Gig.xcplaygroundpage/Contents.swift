 ## Ready for the improv?
 
 - Note:
 Jazz pieces created by Miles are different everytime, enjoy them all!
 
 #### Run the playground now to listen a new improvisation.

 While you listen...
 ## First, let's create our musicians.
 We can create pianos, basses and drums.
 
 Each instrument has its own `Improviser` that creates **MIDI** notes on the spot, like just a real musician does. Improvisers in charge of creating notes, chords, basslines and drum beats that work with each other.

import Miles

let engine = AVAudioEngine()
let bass = Bass(engine: engine, volume: 1, draws: true)
let drums = Drums(engine: engine, withParts: [.ride, .hihats, .snare, .bass], draws: false)
let piano = Piano(engine: engine, for: .comping, volume: 0.8, draws: true)
let pianoSoloer = Piano(engine: engine, for: .soloing, volume: 0.6, draws: true)

 ## Then, we decide which key the musicians will play in.
 
 To do this, we create a `Harmonization` instance. A harmonization sets the key and type of scales we'll use to improvise.
 
 * Experiment:
 Try changing:
 - The key of the harmony
 - The type of harmony
 
 Do your hear the difference in melodies and chords?
 */
let harmonization = Harmonization(key: .Eflat, type: .harmonicMinor)
/*:
 Now, we create a `Sequence` which allows our instruments to work togueter in order to create a song.
 
 * Experiment:
 Try different sequence combinations.
 - Change the tempo to make the music go faster o slower
 - Try removing instruments from the sequence to focus on others
 
 Cool, huh?
 */
let sequence = Sequence(engine: engine, harmonization: harmonization, tempo: 120, withInstruments: [bass, drums, piano, pianoSoloer])
/*:

 ## Now, we create a canvas
 
 So, you thought it could only create music? Wrong!
 Miles syncs cool abstract visuals to the music. It uses a `MilesCanvas` instance to display the generated art.
 
 Can you identify the instruments?
 * Experiment:
 Go back up and change the instrument's _draw_ property to make them draw or stop drawing to the canvas.

// Creates the canvas
let canvas = MilesCanvas()
canvas.scaleMode = .resizeFill
view.presentScene(canvas)

//Link the sequence and the new canvas
sequence.setDrawingCanvas(canvas)

 ## Enjoy!
 We tell our sequence to create an arrangement with the properties we specify and to play it for us to enjoy!
 
 * Experiment:
 Try running Miles several times. The music will be different everytime!
